# Extraction of SLS Patterns from Protein Structures
Studying the SLS from a set of protein structures. 
An SLS is a segment of protein structure containing a stand of a beta-sheet followed by a 
loop/turn and then followed by another stand. The overall task of this project was to classify a set of
input structures into different groups of SLS that differ by the number of amino acids in the loop/turn.
